# jenkins
In this project I am trying to creat my first jenkins job

# ##docker-compose.yml file explanation 
This Docker Compose file defines a service named jenkins that uses the official Jenkins image and allows for customization through a build context. It exposes port 8080, mounts a volume for persistent data, and connects to a custom network. This setup provides a flexible and manageable way to run a Jenkins instance within a Docker environment.

Note:

The build section with context: jenkins-ansible implies that you have a directory named jenkins-ansible containing files or scripts that are used to customize the Jenkins image during the build process.
The networks section only declares the network name. You would need to define other services within the same Docker Compose file that also use the net network for them to communicate
